# 0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL
## Description :house:
Alx-HolbertonBnB is a complete RESTful web application, integrating file and database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. The front-end is designed using HTML5/CSS3 and is served using Python Flask. The application is configured on a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - with Nginx and HAProxy.

Alx-HolbertonBnB is still in active development, with complete functionality set to deploy in the coming month:
* Complete integration of a RESTful API
* Full configuration of website with domain name
* Serving of dynamic content using JavaScript

# Background Context
Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!
* `HBNB_ENV`: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
* `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`: the username of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`: the password of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`: the hostname of your MySQL
* `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`: the database name of your MySQL
* `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using `FileStorage`) or `db` (using `DBStorage`)

# Requirements
## Python Scripts
* All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

# Python Unit Tests
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
* All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
* All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
* All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases

# SQL Scripts
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `MySQL 8.0`
* Your files will be executed with `SQLAlchemy` version `1.4.x`
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
* All your files should start by a comment describing the task
* All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (`SELECT`, `WHERE…`)
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Comments for your SQL file:
```

-- first 3 students in the Batch ID=3
-- because Batch 3 is the best!
SELECT id, name FROM students WHERE batch_id = 3 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;

# Tasks 📃
## 0. Fork me if you can!: [AirBnB_clone_v2](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2)
In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:
* “Who did this code?”
* “How it works?”
* “Where are unittests?”
* “Where is this?”
* “Why did they do that like this?”
* “I don’t understand anything.”
* “… I will refactor everything…”

But the worst thing you could possibly do is to **redo everything**. Please don’t do that! **Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don’t always trust the existing codebase!**

For this project you will fork this [codebase](https://github.com/justinmajetich/AirBnB_clone):
* update the repository name to `AirBnB_clone_v2`
* update the `README.md` with your information but don’t delete the initial authors

If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named `AirBnB_clone_v2` with the same content of `AirBnB_clone`

## 1. Bug free!: [AirBnB_clone_v2](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v2)
Do you remember the `unittest` module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$
```
All your unittests **must** pass without any errors at anytime in this project, **with each storage engine!**. Same for PEP8!
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$
```
Some tests won’t be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the `skipIf` feature of the [Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures). Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

### How to test with MySQL?
First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

“**Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database**”

For example, “you want to validate that the `create State name="California"` command in the console will add a new record in your table `states` in your database”, here steps for your unittest:
* get the number of current records in the table `states` (my using a `MySQLdb` for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it’s better to isolate from the system))
* execute the console command
* get (again) the number of current records in the table `states` (same method, with `MySQLdb`)
* if the difference is `+1` => test passed
